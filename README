## Color Picker

Created to help pick a color scheme for a website without the use of dev tools. Further step to this could be to create some type of click and create site maker. 
For my purposes I have no need for the technology but I could however see the ability to manipulate height and width of elements as well as different views for the color picker.


To build: npm run build

To start the server: npm run start

To start in dev mode, with everything watched: npm run watch
